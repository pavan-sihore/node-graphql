# GraphQL Base Project

A starter Node.js project using GraphQL with Apollo Server, Express, TypeScript, and essential developer tools for rapid development and debugging.


## 🚀 Features

- "GraphQL" with `graphql` and `@apollo/server`
- "Express.js" as the HTTP server
- "TypeScript" support with live reloading
- "Nodemon" and "tsc-watch" for development workflow
- "Logging" with `morgan` and `winston`
- "CORS" and `axios` support for HTTP requests and cross-origin handling

## 🧪 Scripts

| Command         | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm start`     | Starts the compiled JavaScript server            |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs the server with Nodemon (watch mode)        |
| `npm run devts` | Compiles TypeScript and starts server on success |

> 🔄 The `devts` script watches `.ts` files using `tsc-watch` and restarts the app automatically upon changes.


## ✅ Requirements

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* TypeScript installed globally (optional for local development)

## Project Init (To initialize this project from scratch:)

```bash
npm init -y //for intial package.json file creation
npm add nodemon tsc-watch typescript -D //For dev dependency creation
npx tsc --init // for tsconfig.json file creation or typescript config file creation
npx gitignore node //It will create a gitignore file for node js
```

## ✍️ Usage

1. Write your server code in TypeScript in the `src/` directory.
2. Build your TypeScript code (if not using `tsc-watch`):

   ```bash
   tsc
   ```
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Visit the GraphQL playground (usually at `http://localhost:4000/graphql` depending on your server setup).
